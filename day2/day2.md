# Question 4

### **Question:**

> **_Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:_**

```
34,67,55,33,12,98
```

> **_Then, the output should be:_**

```
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
```

# Question 5

### **Question:**

> **_Define a class which has at least two methods:_**
>
> - **_getString: to get a string from console input_**
> - **_printString: to print the string in upper case._**

> **_Also please include simple test function to test the class methods._**

# Question 6

### **Question:**

> **_Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:_**

> **_Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]_**

> **_Following are the fixed values of C and H:_**

> **_C is 50. H is 30._**

> **_D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.For example
> Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:_**

```
100,150,180
```

> **_The output of the program should be:_**

```
18,22,24
```

# Question 7

### **Question:**

> **\_Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i \* j.\***

> **_Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5_**

> **_Then, the output of the program should be:_**

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
```

# Question 8
