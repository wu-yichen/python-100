# Question 60

### **Question**

> **_Write a program to compute:_**

```
f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
and f(0)=0
```

> **_with a given n input by console (n>0)._**

> **_Example:
> If the following n is given as input to the program:_**

```
5
```

> **_Then, the output of the program should be:_**

```
500
```

> **_In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input._**

# Question 61

### **Question**

> **_The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:_**

```
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
```

> **_Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console._**

> **_Example:
> If the following n is given as input to the program:_**

```
7
```

> **_Then, the output of the program should be:_**

```
13
```

> **_In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input._**

# Question 64

### **Question**

> **_Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console._**

> **_Example:
> If the following n is given as input to the program:_**

```
100
```

> **_Then, the output of the program should be:_**

```
0,35,70
```
